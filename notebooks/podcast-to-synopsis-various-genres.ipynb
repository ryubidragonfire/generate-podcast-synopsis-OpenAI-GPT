He explains that two factors led to SVB's downfall: bad decisions at the bank and a rapid increase in interest rates. Rob also talks about how banks operate and how SVB was dealing with an influx of deposits while their costs were rising due to increased interest rates. He then goes on to explain the government's role in protecting depositors' money as well as why there is a two-tier regulatory system for banking in the US. Finally, he emphasizes that panic should be avoided and that most individual banks are in good shape. \\nIn this interview, Robert Armstrong discusses the two-tier system of regulation for banks in the United States since 2008 and how it affects banking today. He explains that while regulators may have to think more carefully about risk posed by securities on balance sheets, a perfectly safe banking system is impossible. He suggests that entrepreneurs and investors ask questions about their bank's capital structure before investing money and encourages them to look beyond appearances when selecting a bank. Armstrong also predicts consequences from the current rate risk crisis, such as slowing economic growth due to investor wariness towards putting equity into banks. However, he believes that because of regulations put in place after 2008, fewer banks will blow up than expected.\""
